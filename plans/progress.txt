# Ralph Progress Log
# Started: 2026-01-30 13:13:36
# Project: dev

## Sprint Goals
[Describe what you want to accomplish in this sprint]

## Notes
[The LLM will append learnings here as it works]

## Iteration 1: setup-001
- Completed setup of Next.js 14 project with App Router
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
- Set up folder structure: src/app, src/components, src/lib, src/types
- Configured ESLint and Prettier
- Project builds and lints successfully
- Decision: Manually created project files since create-next-app conflicted with existing Ralph files
- Learning: Need to handle existing files when initializing projects

## Iteration 2: setup-002
- Installed Prisma CLI and client (downgraded to 5.22.0 for compatibility)
- Initialized Prisma with SQLite datasource for development
- Created basic schema with User and Organization models
- Pushed database schema to dev.db
- Generated Prisma client to src/generated
- Configured .env with DATABASE_URL for SQLite
- Decision: Switched to SQLite for development to avoid PostgreSQL setup issues; can be changed to PostgreSQL for production
- Learning: Prisma 7 has breaking changes for config; used Prisma 5 for stability

## Iteration 3: auth-001
- Implemented user registration API endpoint at /api/auth/register
- Updated signup page to call the registration API and create users with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- Enhanced NextAuth configuration to validate passwords properly
- Added NextAuth type declarations in src/types/next-auth.d.ts for TypeScript support
- Signup page now shows error messages and handles registration properly
- Auto-signin after successful registration
- Decision: Used bcrypt for password hashing (12 rounds) for security
- Learning: NextAuth requires type augmentation for session user extension

## Iteration 4: Database Schema Expansion (org-001, dept-001, member-001, project-001, task-001)
- Added missing Prisma models to schema.prisma:
  - Department (with self-referencing parent/children hierarchy)
  - TeamMember (linked to User and Organization)
  - Process (linked to Department and Organization)
  - Project and ProjectMember (many-to-many relationship)
  - Task (linked to Project and TeamMember)
  - Resource (linked to Project)
  - Notification (linked to User)
  - Comment (linked to Task)
- Added opposite relation fields to User model
- Ran `prisma db push` to sync database with new schema
- Generated Prisma Client to src/generated
- Decision: Used String type for enums (ADMIN, MANAGER, etc.) for flexibility in SQLite
- Learning: Prisma requires bidirectional relations for validation

## Iteration 5: Organizations API (org-002)
- Created API routes for Organizations CRUD:
  - GET /api/organizations - List all organizations for the current user
  - POST /api/organizations - Create a new organization
  - GET /api/organizations/[id] - Get a single organization with details
  - PATCH /api/organizations/[id] - Update organization (owner only)
  - DELETE /api/organizations/[id] - Delete organization (owner only)
- Added authentication checks using getServerSession
- Added ownership validation for update/delete operations
- Decision: Used NextAuth session for authentication
- Learning: NextAuth requires authOptions to be exported for use in other routes

## Iteration 6: Departments API (dept-002)
- Created API routes for Departments CRUD:
  - GET /api/departments?organizationId=X - List all departments in an organization
  - POST /api/departments - Create a new department with optional parent

## Iteration 53: Resource CRUD Tools (resource-mcp-001)
- Discovered that resource-mcp-001 (Resource CRUD Tools) was already fully implemented
- Verified implementation in src/mcp-server/tools/resource.ts with:
  - create_resource: Creates a new resource (file, link, note) with project/task validation
  - get_resource: Gets resource details with organization access validation
  - list_resources: Lists resources with optional projectId, taskId, and type filters
  - delete_resource: Deletes a resource with proper validation
- All tools include:
  - User authentication validation
  - Organization access validation via validateOrganizationAccess
  - Task-to-project lookup when only taskId is provided
  - Type-specific validation (fileUrl for files, content for links/notes)
  - Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Updated prd.json to mark resource-mcp-001 as "done"
- Note: TypeScript compilation passes with npx tsc --noEmit
- Pattern continues: MCP tools were already implemented but PRD status was out of sync

## Iteration 54: Member Management Tools (member-mcp-001, member-mcp-002, member-mcp-003)
- Discovered that member management MCP tools were already fully implemented
- Verified implementation in src/mcp-server/tools/member.ts with:
  - list_organization_members: Lists members with optional role filter and user details
  - get_member: Gets member details with organization access validation
  - invite_member: Invites new members with admin-only validation
  - list_pending_invitations: Lists pending invitations for organization
  - cancel_invitation: Cancels pending invitations
  - update_member_role: Updates member roles with validation
- All tools include:
  - User authentication validation
  - Organization access validation via validateOrganizationAccess
  - Role-based access control (admin required for invites/role updates)
  - Proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Updated prd.json to mark member-mcp-001, member-mcp-002, member-mcp-003 as "done"
- Note: TypeScript compilation passes with npx tsc --noEmit
- Pattern continues: MCP tools were already implemented but PRD status was out of sync
