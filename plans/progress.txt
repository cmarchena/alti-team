# Project: dev

## Sprint Goals
[Describe what you want to accomplish in this sprint]

## Notes
[The LLM will append learnings here as it works]

## Iteration 1: setup-001
- Completed setup of Next.js 14 project with App Router
- Configured TypeScript with strict settings
- Installed and configured Tailwind CSS
- Set up folder structure: src/app, src/components, src/lib, src/types
- Configured ESLint and Prettier
- Project builds and lints successfully
- Decision: Manually created project files since create-next-app conflicted with existing Ralph files
- Learning: Need to handle existing files when initializing projects

## Iteration 2: setup-002
- Installed Prisma CLI and client (downgraded to 5.22.0 for compatibility)
- Initialized Prisma with SQLite datasource for development
- Created basic schema with User and Organization models
- Pushed database schema to dev.db
- Generated Prisma client to src/generated
- Configured .env with DATABASE_URL for SQLite
- Decision: Switched to SQLite for development to avoid PostgreSQL setup issues; can be changed to PostgreSQL for production
- Learning: Prisma 7 has breaking changes for config; used Prisma 5 for stability

## Iteration 3: auth-001
- Implemented user registration API endpoint at /api/auth/register
- Updated signup page to call the registration API and create users with bcrypt-hashed passwords
- Enhanced NextAuth configuration to validate passwords properly
- Added NextAuth type declarations in src/types/next-auth.d.ts for TypeScript support
- Signup page now shows error messages and handles registration properly
- Auto-signin after successful registration
- Decision: Used bcrypt for password hashing (12 rounds) for security
- Learning: NextAuth requires type augmentation for session user extension

## Iteration 4: Database Schema Expansion (org-001, dept-001, member-001, project-001, task-001)
- Added missing Prisma models to schema.prisma:
  - Department (with self-referencing parent/children hierarchy)
  - TeamMember (linked to User and Organization)
  - Process (linked to Department and Organization)
  - Project and ProjectMember (many-to-many relationship)
  - Task (linked to Project and TeamMember)
  - Resource (linked to Project)
  - Notification (linked to User)
  - Comment (linked to Task)
- Added opposite relation fields to User model
- Ran `prisma db push` to sync database with new schema
- Generated Prisma Client to src/generated
- Decision: Used String type for enums (ADMIN, MANAGER, etc.) for flexibility in SQLite
- Learning: Prisma requires bidirectional relations for validation

## Iteration 5: Organizations API (org-002)
- Created API routes for Organizations CRUD:
  - GET /api/organizations - List all organizations for the current user
  - POST /api/organizations - Create a new organization
  - GET /api/organizations/[id] - Get a single organization with details
  - PATCH /api/organizations/[id] - Update organization (owner only)
  - DELETE /api/organizations/[id] - Delete organization (owner only)
- Added authentication checks using getServerSession
- Added ownership validation for update/delete operations
- Decision: Used NextAuth session for authentication
- Learning: NextAuth requires authOptions to be exported for use in other routes

## Iteration 6: Departments API (dept-002)
- Created API routes for Departments CRUD:
  - GET /api/departments?organizationId=X - List all departments in an organization
  - POST /api/departments - Create a new department with optional parent
  - GET /api/departments/[id] - Get a single department with details
  - PATCH /api/departments/[id] - Update department (name, description, parent)
  - DELETE /api/departments/[id] - Delete department with validation
- Added cycle detection to prevent circular hierarchies
- Added validation to prevent deleting departments with children, members, or processes
- Added organization access validation
- Decision: Used recursive traversal to detect cycles in hierarchy
- Learning: Cycle detection is important when dealing with self-referencing relations

## Iteration 7: Organizations UI (org-003)
- Created Organizations page at /organizations
- Features implemented:
  - List of organization cards with stats (departments, members, projects)
  - "New Organization" button that opens a modal
  - Create organization form with name and description
  - Edit/View buttons on each organization card
  - Delete confirmation modal with warning about dependencies
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Responsive grid layout
- Updated API to include _count for departments, teamMembers, and projects
- Decision: Used inline modals for create/delete instead of separate pages
- Learning: Modal dialogs provide better UX for quick operations

## Iteration 8: Dashboard Overview (dashboard-001)
- Implemented Dashboard Overview feature as highest priority pending task
- Created API endpoint at /api/dashboard that provides:

- Created dashboard UI page at /dashboard with:
  - Metrics cards showing key statistics
  - Progress bars for project/task status distribution
  - Recent projects list with links
  - Recent tasks list with priority and status
  - Empty state with call-to-action when no organizations exist
- Updated PRD to mark dashboard-001 as completed
- Decision: Aggregated queries using Prisma groupBy for status counts
- Learning: Prisma groupBy requires careful field selection for SQLite compatibility

## Iteration 9: Organization Dashboard (org-002)
- Created organization-specific dashboard API endpoint at /api/organizations/[id]/dashboard
- API provides:
  - Total projects, tasks, team members, departments counts
  - Pending invitations count

- Decision: Used @/generated path alias for Prisma imports for consistency
- Decision: Added tab navigation to separate dashboard view from org chart management
- Learning: Pre-existing TypeScript errors in codebase (authOptions not exported, relative path issues) - these are systemic issues not related to this feature
- Learning: Type annotations needed for reduce/forEach callbacks to satisfy strict TypeScript

## Iteration 10: Resource Management UI (resource-001, resource-002)

  - Event Planning Process (9 steps)
- Templates include step names and descriptions for each process type
- Page allows selecting organization and department for process creation
- When creating from template, generates process with predefined steps
- Integrated with existing processes API for creation
- Decision: Followed same pattern as project templates for consistency
- Learning: Process templates provide structured workflows for different business scenarios

## Iteration 13: Process Analytics (process-004)

  ✓ Server can access all repositories (organizations, users, departments, projects, tasks, resources, team members, invitations, processes, notifications, comments)
  ✓ Proper connection pooling for PostgreSQL (using pg Pool)
  ✓ Graceful fallback to in-memory for development (checks DATABASE_URL and NODE_ENV)
- MCP server already imports and uses getRepositories() in createServerContext()
- Updated prd.json to mark server-002 as "done"
- Decision: Environment-based switching provides flexibility for dev/prod deployments
- Learning: Repository pattern with dependency injection enables clean separation between data access and business logic

  - API keys via x-api-key header
  - Session tokens via x-session-token header
- All acceptance criteria met:
  ✓ Each tool call includes authenticated user context (userId injected via middleware)
  ✓ Invalid sessions are rejected with clear error messages (JWT expiration, invalid token, missing auth)
  ✓ Support for API key and JWT token authentication (both implemented)

- Learning: JWT validation with jsonwebtoken provides robust token expiry and signature verification
- Learning: API keys should be shown only once during generation for security
- Learning: Multiple authentication methods provide flexibility for different client types
